This is simple tutorial how to make smart lamp with ESP8266. Before you begin here you can look at video how the end result will look:

The lamp is controlled using two touch sensors and wifi (in hotspot mode).

## What will you need?
First of all you will need some lamp. It should be lamp powered by external power supply (the thing which you plug into power outlet is somewhat bigger that classical plug). Also there should be output voltage writen on the power supply or lamp. Anything from 9 to 24V is fine as those all are safe voltages for human touch so you can't hurt yourself.

Next you will need to buy few things:

- [ESP8266](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32656775273.html)
- [Step down power supply](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33015256539.html)
- [Touch sensor](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000540638639.html)
- [Transistor](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32878220199.html)

Also you will need some other things that you probably have lying around:

- Electrical tape + heat shrink tube
- Some wires
- Paper or some other stuff for filling space
- Micro USB cable
